## üêå Performance Problem

A clear and concise description of the performance issue you're experiencing.

## üìä Current Performance

**What is the current performance?**
- **Operation:** [e.g., factor calculation, config loading, CPU computation]
- **Current time:** [e.g., 5 seconds for 1000 NFTs]
- **Resource usage:** [e.g., CPU: 80%, Memory: 2GB]
- **Scale:** [e.g., 1000 NFTs, 100 factors]

## üéØ Expected Performance

**What performance do you expect?**
- **Target time:** [e.g., 1 second for 1000 NFTs]
- **Resource usage:** [e.g., CPU: 20%, Memory: 500MB]

## üîÑ Steps to Reproduce

1. Load configuration with `LoadMineSeasonConfig()`
2. Create calculator with `CPUCalculator()`
3. Process [X] NFTs with [Y] factors
4. Observe slow performance

**Code example:**
```python
from pow2core.config.load_config import LoadMineSeasonConfig
from pow2core.cpu.calculator import CPUCalculator
import time

# Start timing
start_time = time.time()

config_loader = LoadMineSeasonConfig()
season_config = config_loader.load_config("gcw-s6")
calculator = CPUCalculator(season_config.cpu)
calculator.load_factors()

# Process NFTs
for nft in nft_list:
    result = calculator.calculate(nft)

# End timing
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Processing time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
```
